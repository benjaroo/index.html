<h2>Ben Drew</h2>
<p>My name is John Bennett Drew Jr. I go by Ben. I am 20 years old and I have been kayaking for almost 4 years now. My friend, Jackson Singleton, finally convinced me to get into a kayak and it was love at first boof. Soon after I started kayaking I was introduced to two guys from Long Creek, South Carolina, named Holt McWhirt and Hunter Cooper. They called themselves "Long Creek Gangstas" and they are going to be the best kayakers of the next generation. Raised on the banks of the Chattooga River, these kids shred. Jackson was already part of their crew and when he brought me along they accepted me as their own. Now we are all known as "The Long Creek Boys" and we travel all over the United States in search of the best flows and biggest rapids. Thanks to Liquidlogic Kayaks, I get to paddle the best kayak designs that will stand up to any feature I run. My favorite boats to paddle are the tried and true Remix, the game changing Braaaap and the ridiculously fast Stinger.   </p>
